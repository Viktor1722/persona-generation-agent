## Interview Transcript

### Q1: Tell me about the last time you had trouble reconciling your accounts—what happened and what did you do next?

Oh, that was a nightmare. Last month, I was trying to reconcile our accounts, and I noticed some numbers just weren't adding up. I had been switching between Shopify, Excel, and our payment processor, and somewhere along the line, things got jumbled. I ended up with hours of mismatched data.

I was so frustrated, I just shut off all the notifications because they were driving me nuts. I called a quick team huddle and we decided to revert to paper trails for a couple of days to get a clear picture. It was a bit old-school, but it worked. I really need a system that keeps everything in one place and doesn't make me feel like I'm drowning in data.

---

### Q2: Walk me through how a typical sale moves from your e‑commerce platform into your accounting records—who does each step and how long does each take?

Alright, so when a sale comes through our e-commerce platform, it first pops up on our order dashboard. I check this twice a day to make sure everything's running smoothly. My operations lead usually handles the initial processing—making sure the inventory is updated and the order is ready to ship. This part is pretty quick, maybe 10-15 minutes per order.

Once the order is shipped, the details need to get into our accounting records. This is where things can get a bit tricky. We still rely on Excel for some of this, so my finance person will manually input the data. It's not the most efficient system, and it can take a couple of hours each week to reconcile everything. I've been looking for a tool that can streamline this without making me feel like I need a tech degree to use it.

Honestly, I just want something simple that doesn't disrupt our flow or make me worry about data mismatches.

---

### Q3: When was the most recent time you generated financial reports that didn't match your expectations—what was wrong and how did you resolve it?

Oh, I remember just last month, I was pulling together our monthly sales report in Excel, and the numbers just didn't add up. I had this sinking feeling because I knew it meant hours of digging. Turns out, there was a mismatch between our inventory system and the sales dashboard. I ended up spending a whole afternoon cross-referencing everything manually.

To fix it, I called a quick team huddle and we decided to revert to paper trails for a couple of days while we sorted out the glitch. It was frustrating, but I needed to make sure we had accurate data. I'm really hoping to find a more reliable system soon because I can't keep losing time like that.

---

### Q4: What tools do you currently use to manage sales, inventory, and bookkeeping, and when did you start using each one?

I use Shopify for managing sales and inventory. I started with it about three years ago because it was straightforward and didn't require a tech degree to set up. For bookkeeping, I still rely on Excel. It's not fancy, but I know how to make it work for me. I've been using Excel since the beginning, and while it can be a bit of a pain to reconcile everything, it's familiar. I also use WhatsApp for quick team updates. Honestly, I just need things that are simple and reliable, without any hidden surprises.

---

### Q5: Tell me about the last time your accounting process delayed a business decision—what was the decision and who was impacted?

Honestly, the last time my accounting process delayed a decision was a real headache. We were trying to decide whether to invest in a new line of eco-friendly products. I had to reconcile our finances to see if we could afford it, but I got stuck in Excel for hours. The data from our sales and expenses just didn't match up, and I was pulling my hair out trying to figure it out.

It impacted my whole team because we had to put the product launch on hold. My operations lead and customer-service supervisor were both waiting on me to give the green light, and I felt terrible for holding things up. It was frustrating because I just needed a clear picture of our finances, but the tools I had were making it harder, not easier.

---

### Q6: When was the last time you considered or trialed a new finance or accounting tool—what triggered that and what steps did you take during the trial?

Honestly, the last time I considered a new finance tool was about three months ago. I was drowning in spreadsheets, trying to reconcile everything for tax season, and it was a nightmare. I needed something that wouldn't make me feel like I was back in school trying to learn a foreign language.

What triggered it was a particularly chaotic week where I spent hours trying to match up numbers, and I still ended up with discrepancies. I decided enough was enough. I started by asking my operations lead and finance person for recommendations. We narrowed it down to three options that promised simplicity and reliability.

During the trial, I focused on how easy it was to set up and whether it could integrate smoothly with our existing systems like Shopify. I tested it with real data to see if it could handle our daily sales and inventory without hiccups. I also kept an eye on how responsive their support was because I can't afford to wait days for help. In the end, if it felt like it was adding more stress than solving problems, it was a no-go.

---

### Q7: Think about last month: how many hours did you and your team spend on bookkeeping and reconciliations, and what tasks took the most time?

Oh, last month was a bit of a nightmare with bookkeeping. I'd say we spent around 15 hours just trying to get everything in order. The biggest time sink was definitely reconciling the inventory with sales. We had some data mismatches between our order dashboard and the inventory counts, which meant a lot of back-and-forth checking. I ended up reverting to paper trails for a couple of days just to make sure we weren't missing anything. It's frustrating because I just want a system that works without all this hassle.

---

### Q8: Describe a workaround you've created because your current software didn't meet a need—when did you use it and what was the outcome?

Oh, I've definitely had to get creative a few times. One big workaround I came up with was when our inventory system kept glitching. It was driving me nuts because it would show different stock levels than what we actually had. So, I started doing a manual count every week and kept a paper log. It was a bit old-school, but it saved us from overselling items we didn't have. I'd update the system manually after each count. It wasn't ideal, but it kept things running smoothly until we sorted out the software issues. It's all about keeping things reliable and making sure our customers aren't disappointed.

---

### Q9: Tell me about the last time you had to hire external help (an accountant, consultant, or developer) because of software limitations—what did they do and what did it cost?

Honestly, the last time I had to bring in external help was when our inventory system started acting up. It was a nightmare. We were getting mismatched data between our sales and stock levels, and I just couldn't figure it out. I ended up hiring a consultant who specialized in e-commerce systems. They came in, did a full audit, and helped us streamline the process. It cost us about $2,000, which was painful, but it was necessary to keep things running smoothly. I just wish the software was more reliable from the start so I didn't have to go through all that hassle.

---

### Q10: Who is involved in purchasing or approving new business tools at your company, and how did they participate in the last tool decision?

When we're looking at new business tools, it's usually me, the operations lead, and the customer-service supervisor who get involved. I rely a lot on their feedback because they're the ones in the trenches. Last time, when we decided on a new inventory management system, we all sat down and went through a few options together. I made sure to test them with real data to see how they'd hold up. The finance team also had a look to make sure everything fit our budget. It took about three weeks from start to finish, and I was really focused on finding something reliable and easy to use. I can't stand hidden costs or complicated setups, so we were pretty thorough.

---

### Q11: Describe the specific criteria you actually used the last time you chose accounting software and how you compared options.

Honestly, choosing accounting software was a bit of a headache for me. I'm not a tech person, so I needed something straightforward. The last time I picked one, I focused on a few key things: it had to integrate smoothly with Shopify, offer clear and predictable pricing, and have solid customer support. I can't stand hidden fees or complex setups.

I compared about three options. I looked for a simple interface because I don't have time to learn something complicated. I also ran a quick test with real data to see how it handled our transactions. My operations lead and I checked if it could handle our inventory and sales data without glitches. In the end, I went with the one that felt most reliable and easy to use, even if it wasn't the cheapest. I just need to trust that it won't mess up our numbers.

---

### Q12: Tell me about the most recent time data from a sales channel failed to sync with your accounting system—what happened and how did you fix it?

Oh, that was a real headache. Just last month, I noticed that our sales data from Shopify wasn't syncing properly with our accounting system. It was a mess—orders were missing, and the numbers just didn't add up. I felt like I was drowning in mismatched data.

I immediately called a quick team huddle to figure out what was going on. We decided to revert to our trusty paper trails for a couple of days while we sorted it out. I had to manually reconcile everything in Excel, which took hours and was incredibly frustrating.

Eventually, we realized it was a glitch in the integration. I got on the phone with support, and thankfully, they were responsive and helped us patch things up. But honestly, I just want a system that works without these hiccups. I need reliability so I can focus on keeping our customers happy, not wrestling with tech issues.

---

### Q13: Describe the last instance you were late on a payment, tax filing, or reconciliation because of your current processes—what led to the delay?

Honestly, the last time I was late on a reconciliation was a bit of a nightmare. I had a bunch of orders come in during a sale, and the data between Shopify and my Excel sheets just didn't match up. I spent hours trying to figure out where things went wrong. It was one of those moments where I had over five unread notifications across different apps, and I just shut them off because it was too much. I ended up reverting to paper trails for a couple of days to get things sorted. It was frustrating because I just need things to be simple and reliable, and that day, they weren't.

---

### Q14: When you evaluated new finance software recently, which features did you test in practice, how did you test them, and what stopped you from switching?

When I was looking at new finance software, I focused on a few key features. First, I needed something that could integrate smoothly with Shopify because that's where all our sales data lives. I tested this by running a few dummy transactions to see if everything synced up without a hitch.

I also checked how easy it was to generate reports. I'm used to Excel, so I wanted something that wouldn't make me feel like I needed a degree in finance to understand. I tried creating a basic sales report and compared it to what I usually do in Excel to see if it matched up.

What stopped me from switching was the onboarding process. It felt like I needed a manual just to get started, and the pricing wasn't as clear as I'd like. Plus, I heard from a couple of other boutique owners that their support was slow, and I can't afford to be stuck waiting when something goes wrong. I need reliability and simplicity, and this just didn't cut it.

---

### Q15: When was the last time you began a formal evaluation of a new finance tool, what triggered that evaluation, and what were the next steps your team took?

Honestly, the last time I started looking at a new finance tool was about three months ago. We were having a nightmare with mismatched data between our sales and inventory, and it was eating up hours every week. I just couldn't keep wasting time on manual reconciliations.

So, I called a quick team huddle to get everyone's input, especially from our operations lead and finance. We needed something that wouldn't disrupt our flow but would give us accurate numbers without the headache. We narrowed it down to three options that seemed simple and reliable.

We set up a one-month pilot with real data to see how each tool handled our needs. I was clear about needing strong onboarding and support, and I made sure the pricing was straightforward. It took about four weeks to decide, and I signed off after our finance team gave the green light. The whole process was a bit stressful, but I needed to be sure we wouldn't lose our personal touch with customers.
